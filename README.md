# Library for handling the (dense) data created by the GATE LearningFramework plugin

This contains functionality for handling the original (JSON format) files
as well as reading in data from these files and automatically convert to 
the correct Numpy arrays representation for use with one of the Python deep learning backends.

NOTE: currently this is all very experimental and may change at any time in unexpected and
frustrating ways!
