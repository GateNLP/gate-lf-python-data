# gate-lf-python-data - A Library for using JSON data from the GATE LearningFramework

This is a python library that deals with using training files created in "dense JSON format" 
by the GATE LearningFramework plugin. The library is meant to get used by other Python libraries
which actually implement or interface to learning algorithms, e.g. gate-lf-pytorch-json.
